# RaritanAutomation
During the summer of 2016 I worked with Raritan Inc. as an intern. While there I created a framework with methods and classes to run automated tests for the web interface of one of their devices. This code was completed using Selenium which is based in Python coding.

There are three different files attatched to this file:

1. Automation Framework_User Management: This is a listing of all the methods that were included in the framework. It allows access and modification of each element on each page.

2. Python Selenium Tutorial: This is a breakdown of how to use the methods as well as create new ones. The document was created so that once my internship at Raritan was completed the developers there would be able to use and understand the framework that I created.

3. Test2685_NetworkStats: A sample test case which implements the structure that I created
